# My React JS Project

This is a React JS project that I am working on. It is still under development, but I am excited to share it with you.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

1. Users should have the ability to upload a JSON file, and the file should be stored locally on
the frontend side. (Please refer attached an example JSON file.)
2. Email addresses must be unique. If the JSON file contains duplicate email addresses, the
duplicate records should be automatically removed from the list while uploading the JSON
file.
3. Users can upload JSON files multiple times. In such cases, the data from subsequent
uploads should be merged with the data from the first uploaded JSON file.
4.. Display all records with pagination on the main screen.
5. Implement a search bar that allows users to search for records by ID, Name, or Email. The
search functionality should trigger on each key up event.
6. Users should be able to edit or delete any record.
7. When editing a record, users must enter a unique email address. Otherwise, a validation
error should be displayed.
8. When a record is deleted, it should be removed from the JSON file list, and the page should
display the updated list of records.
